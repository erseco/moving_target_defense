    abstract = {An important way cyber adversaries find vulnerabilities in modern networks is through reconnaissance, in which they attempt to identify configuration specifics of network hosts. To increase uncertainty of adversarial reconnaissance, the network administrator (henceforth, defender) can introduce deception into responses to network scans, such as obscuring certain system characteristics. We introduce a novel game theoretic model of deceptive interactions of this kind between a defender and a cyber attacker, which we call the Cyber Deception Game. We consider both a powerful (rational) attacker, who is aware of the defender's exact deception strategy, and a naive attacker who is not. We show that computing the optimal deception strategy is {NP}-hard for both types of attackers. For the case with a powerful attacker, we provide a mixed-integer linear program solution as well as a fast and effective greedy algorithm. Similarly, we provide complexity results and propose exact and heuristic approaches when the attacker is naive. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approaches.},

Despite increased adoption of {OSS} products, questions about their security and reliability remain. Using four popular {OSS} and proprietary products as an initial sample, we examine the vulnerability patterns in {OSS} and proprietary products. Our analysis suggests that for both proprietary and open source products, in general, severe vulnerabilities are identified relatively late in the product’ s life and continue to emerge months after the software release. In particular, contrary to expectations, detection of vulnerabilities is no faster in open source ({OS}) than proprietary products. However, open source products had lower count of vulnerabiliti es at all levels of severity compared to proprietary products. We propose a conceptual framework to explain the variations in vulnerabilities between the {OS} and proprietary products. Our insights from the study have implications for research and practice.},

    abstract = {A recent report criticising the security of open source software, and a flame war among Linux developers, have cast some doubts on whether open source software can achieve a sufficiently high level of security. Yet others believe that the principles of transparency and community involvement actually contribute to higher levels of software quality, including security, than can be achieved in the closed world of proprietary software. It's an important issue as open source projects continue their inroads into mainstream, enterprise solutions. Steve Mansfield-Devine examines the arguments and touches on the efforts being made to develop best practices, methodologies and tools to ensure security in open source software. Debates about open source software quickly develop a religious dimension. And nothing is more likely to set off an argument of inquisitional proportions than accusations of shortcomings in an area as important as security. Two recent events highlighted the issue of the security of open source software ({OSS}): one was a report claiming that open source developers are failing to achieve the necessary standards. The other was a suggestion that Linux kernel developers may have tried to cover up security vulnerabilities. However, when it comes to ensuring the quality of software from a security standpoint, is there really any difference between open source and closed source?},

    abstract = {Protection against many cyber security threats can be implemented by existing software on the system, with no need for security software. Some operating systems or program parameters can increase the security level and close any vulnerabilities if they are set properly. This project shows a way to prevent potential attacks with relatively low cost, but this method needs immediate attention. Reconfiguring a machine regularly is a moving target defense which is done by modifying the configuration regularly in the hopes of spoiling an attacker's reconnaissance efforts, the configurations are changed until they reach the fittest solution, so if the configurations are modified after a potential attacker's reconnaissance, then the gathered information is no longer effective. Improving security and utilizing the moving target defense can be implemented through the use of a genetic algorithm. Vulnerabilities can be caused by human misconfiguration or by having the improper chain of parameters, which are impossible to find manually due to the large number of configurations to search through. The genetic algorithm is therefore used to fix this problem by finding the right configuration and the proper chain of parameters until it reaches the fittest configuration possible, which is the main objective of this project. The {GA} has been applied successfully and it has shown flexibility in tightening the security solution by evolving the fitness of the configuration through the generations and by maintaining diversity within the generations. This resulted in high quality configurations which are important within the moving target defense strategy. Investigating the security impact on the Quality of Service ({QoS}) was an objective of this project. It is believed that maintaining good {QoS} is as important as having good security and this project shows that the security level has a significant impact on the {QoS}.},

Although the division of the control and data planes on networks has lead to dynamic reconfigurability of large networks, finding the minimal and optimal set of controllers that can adapt to the changes in the network has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent research tends to favor small solution sets with a focus on either propagation latency or controller load distribution, and struggles to find large balanced solution sets. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based approach to the controller placement problem that minimizes inter-controller latency, load distribution and the number of controllers with fitness sharing. We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides diverse and adaptive solutions to real network architectures such as the United States backbone and Japanese backbone networks. We further discuss the relevance and application of a diversity focused genetic algorithm for a moving target defense security model.},

One approach to this defense strategy is to intermittently change a system's configuration. These changes must maintain functionality and security, while also being diverse. Finding suitable configuration changes that form a {MT} defense is challenging. There are potentially a large number of individual configurations' settings to consider, without a full understanding of the settings' interdependencies. Evolution-based algorithms, which formulate better solutions from good solutions, can be used to create a {MT} defense. New configurations are created based on the security of previous configurations and can be periodically implemented to change the system's attack surface. This approach not only has the ability to discover new, more secure configurations, but is also proactive and resilient since it can continually adapt to the current environment in a fashion similar to systems found in nature. This article presents and compares two genetic algorithms to create a {MT} defense. The primary difference between the two is based on their approaches to mutation. One mutates values, and the other modifies the domains from which values are chosen.},

    title = {Improving the Diversity Defense of Genetic Algorithm-Based Moving Target Approaches},
    abstract = {One approach for providing a Moving Target ({MT}) defense is to intermediately change a system’s configuration (operating systems and/or applications). For example, Genetic Algorithms ({GAs}) have been successfully used to find alternative configurations that can discount the attacker’s knowledge about the system. Central to the {GA} approach is the chromosome pool, which consists of the best alternative configurations discovered thus far. Unfortunately the pool can possibly “stagnate” if these configurations do not change after a period of time. Although the configurations are secure, this situation limits the diversity the approach can achieve. This paper describes how chromosome pool management can improve the diversity of {GA}-based {MT} environments. The proposed approach “ages” configurations, reducing the fitness (security) of a configuration based on the period of time since it was last active (used as the configuration for the system). As a result, configurations that not been active for a long period of time are considered less secure which can make space in the pool for new alternatives. Simulations results will demonstrate proper pool management can provide a functional, secure, and more diverse {MT} environment.},

Knowledge gained through reconnaissance often allows them to ﬁnd ways in which to exploit the system. Moving target defense ({MTD}) is a security strategy that inhibits the reconnaissance phase of an attack by making the system change the way it is conﬁgured, while it is running, at random intervals. The changes a moving target defense implements should maintain system functionality as well as security. Depending on the system being protected the possible number of parameters that can change can be very large. Finding ways to change the parameters that ensure system security is challenging, but with the help of genetic algorithms it can be done eﬀectively. This paper describes the basics of moving target defense, highlights three speciﬁc challenges that go in to the making of an {MTD}, and explains how genetic algorithms can be leveraged to address those challenges.},

This approach has been realized as a prototype for self-protection in the Hydra middleware, and is integrated with a framework for enforcing the computed solution at run time using security obligations.

    abstract = {There is no denying the fact that with the widespread usage of computers and the Internet in our daily lives, security of information and data has gained increased attention. Information stored in electronic form is more susceptible to being leaked to unauthorized individuals intentionally or without intent. One of the major reasons for this breach of security has been attributed to proprietary software whose source is available only to the company which made it. Thus you have no surety that the proprietary and pre-compiled software has no hole to help an individual break security of your computer or network. Philosophy of free and open source software as against this provides everyone an opportunity to view the source code for any possible vulnerabilities and compile and change it according to ones need. This paper discusses this philosophy in length with some examples and also some open source tools that help maintain computer and Internet security.},

    doi = {10.1109/CEC.2016.7743980},
    abstract = {It is not usual practice in the evolutionary algorithms area to benchmark different operations in order to choose the best language for a single or multilanguage implementation. Researchers rely instead on common practice or frameworks using mainstream languages. That is why it is usual practice to choose compiled languages (namely Java or C/C++) when implementing evolutionary algorithms, without considering other languages or rejecting them outright on the basis of performance. Since there is a myriad of languages nowadays, we considered it an interesting challenge to measure their speed when performing frequent operations in evolutionary algorithms. In this paper we have tested three basic evolutionary algorithm operations over binary chromosomes: bitflip mutation, crossover and the {OneMax} fitness function. As a performance measure, the speed for both popular and not so popular computer languages have been used. In general, the results confirm that compiled languages scale and perform better, but also in some cases have a behaviour that is independent of the size of the chromosome. Additionally, results show that other languages, such as Go (compiled) or Python (interpreted) are fast enough for most purposes. Besides, these experiments show which of these operations are, in fact, the best for choosing an implementation language based on its performance.},

    abstract = {Attacks often succeed by abusing the gap between program and machine-level semantics-- for example, by locating a sensitive pointer, exploiting a bug to overwrite this sensitive data, and hijacking the victim program's execution. In this work, we take secure system design on the offensive by continuously obfuscating information that attackers need but normal programs do not use, such as representation of code and pointers or the exact location of code and data. Our secure hardware architecture, Morpheus, combines two powerful protections: ensembles of moving target defenses and churn. Ensembles of moving target defenses randomize key program values (e.g., relocating pointers and encrypting code and pointers) which forces attackers to extensively probe the system prior to an attack. To ensure attack probes fail, the architecture incorporates churn to transparently re-randomize program values underneath the running system. With frequent churn, systems quickly become impractically difficult to penetrate. We demonstrate Morpheus through a {RISC}-V-based prototype designed to stop control-flow attacks. Each moving target defense in Morpheus uses hardware support to individually offer more randomness at a lower cost than previous techniques. When ensembled with churn, Morpheus defenses offer strong protection against control-flow attacks, with our security testing and performance studies revealing: i) high-coverage protection for a broad array of control-flow attacks, including protections for advanced attacks and an attack disclosed after the design of Morpheus, and ii) negligible performance impacts (1\%) with churn periods up to 50 ms, which our study estimates to be at least 5000x faster than the time necessary to possibly penetrate Morpheus.},
